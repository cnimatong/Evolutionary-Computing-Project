    "## Introduction {-}\n",
    "Evolutionary computing is a fascinating branch of artificial intelligence that leverages mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. This project focuses on creating and evolving creatures within a simulated environment using genetic algorithms. The primary objective is to explore how different encoding schemes and experimental setups impact the evolution of these creatures in terms of fitness and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Experiments {-}\n",
    "The initial experiments aimed to establish a baseline for the creaturesâ€™ evolution using a control setup. These experiments utilized a simple genetic algorithm with a defined population size, gene count, crossover rate, and mutation rates. The primary goal was to observe how these parameters affect the fitness and structure of the evolved creatures over multiple iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment Parameters {-}\n",
    "| Experiment Name    | Population Size | Gene Count | Crossover Rate | Point Mutation Rate | Shrink Mutation Rate | Grow Mutation Rate | Non-Evolvable Genes |\n",
    "|--------------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n",

    "\n",
    "These parameters were carefully selected to provide a balanced approach to evolution, allowing for sufficient genetic diversity while maintaining a manageable population size for computational feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fitness Function {-}\n",
    "The fitness function os a cruicial component of the evolutionary algorithm as it determines the quality of each creature. In this project, the fitness function evaluates creatures based on three key components: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Distance Traveled\n",
    "- Proximity to Mountain\n",
    "- Height Achieved\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation of Fitness {-}\n",
    "The fitness function is calculated as follows:\n",
    "${ \\text{Fitness} = (w_{\\text{distance}} \\times \\text{Distance Traveled}) + (w_{\\text{proximity}} \\times \\frac{1}{\\text{Proximity to Mountain} + 1}) + (w_{\\text{height}} \\times \\text{Height Achieved}) }$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distance Traveled:** This component measures how far the creature has moved from its starting position. It encourages exploration and mobility.\n",
    "- **Proximity to Mountain:** This component rewards creatures that get closer to the mountain, which simulates the ability to navigate towards a goal.\n",
    "- **Height Achieved:** This component rewards creatures that achieve higher altitudes whilst touching the mountain, simulating the ability of climbing the mountain, and encourages the evolution of creatures capable of climbing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weight factors {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights for each component are chosen to balance their contributions to the overall fitness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weight for Distance Traveled ( $w_{\\text{distance}}$ ): 0.1**\n",
    "- **Weight for Proximity ( $w_{\\text{proximity}}$ ): 0.4**\n",
    "- **Weight for Height ( $w_{\\text{height}}$ ): 0.5**\n",
    "\n",
    "These weights were selected to ensure that the fitness function appropriately rewards behaviours that enhance survival and adaptability in the simulated environment. The fitness functions design encourages the evolution of creatures that are not only mobile but also capable of navigating complex terrains and achieving higher altitudes on the mountain.\n",

    "## Conclusion {-}\n",
    "The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of evolutionary computing in evolving creatures with varying fitness and complexity. The control experiment established a baseline, while the encoding scheme experiments revealed the impact of different genetic configurations on the evolutionary process. The exceptional criteria with sensory input highlighted the potential for more advanced adaptations. By adding sensory input, the creatures became more responsive to their environment, leading to significant improvements in their fitness and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could explore more complex sensory inputs, multi-objective optimization, and real-world applications of evolved creatures in robotics and artificial intelligence. For instance, integrating sensors for light, sound, or other environmental factors could lead to even more sophisticated behaviors. Additionally, optimizing for multiple objectives, such as energy efficiency and speed, could create more well-rounded and practical solutions for real-world applications.\n",
